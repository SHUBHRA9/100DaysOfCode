Question : Shortest Common Supersequence

Given two strings X and Y of lengths m and n respectively, find the length of the smallest string which has both, X and Y as its sub-sequences.
Note: X and Y can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Test Case 1 :
Input: X = abcd, Y = xycd
Output: 6
Explanation: Shortest Common Supersequence would be abxycd which is of length 6 and has both the strings as its subsequences.

Test Case 2 :
Input: X = efgh, Y = jghi
Output: 6
Explanation: Shortest Common Supersequence would be ejfghi which is of length 6 and has both the strings as its subsequences.

Your Task:
Complete shortestCommonSupersequence() function that takes X, Y, m, and n as arguments and returns the length of the required string.
