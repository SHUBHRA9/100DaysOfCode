Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Test Case 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Teast Case 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Test Case 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
