Question : Equilibrium Point

Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
Return -1 if no such point exists.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Test Case 1 :-
Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 
Explanation:  Equilibrium point is at position 3 as elements before it (1+3) = elements after it (2+2). 

Test Case 2 :-
Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation: Since its the only element hence its the only equilibrium point.

Test Case 3 :-
Input:
n=2
Explanation: For 2 elements it is not possible to find equilibrium, except for thecase where input would be [1,0] or [0,1].

Test Case 4 :-
Input:
n=0
Explanation: Since there is no element in the input, so, this test case would be invalid.


Code Explanation : The program is to create to calculate the total sum of the array first. Then Iterate through the array and keep updating the left sum which is initialized as zero. 
				   In the loop, we can get the right sum by subtracting the elements one by one. If we come out of loop without returning then there is no equilibrium index.
